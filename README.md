## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- That we (frontend devs) should avoid *pixel-perfection* because it simply doesn't exist in the world of responsive design. Many factors dictate how the UI will look on a certain device and it's impractical to manually fix the discrepancies on all of the different devices, but we can (and we *should*) aim for, [as Josh Comeau would say](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/pixel-perfection/), *pixel-pretty-close*.
